            <p class="paragraph-happy-hour"><strong>HAPPY HOUR IS MY FAV!</strong> Beers, drinks, food, and networking.

        <h3 class="h3-format">CROSS-COMPANY TRAINING</h3>
        <p>Joint training sessions or workshops for the employees of Halborn and partner companies. Imagine how cool a Hackerhouse could be if it included cross-company sessions while sharing space and activities throughout a full weekend!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="idea-item">
        <img id="idea2" src="/idea_2.jpg"/>
        <h3 class="h3-format">HALBORN TALKS (PODCAST)</h3>
        <p>Although Halborn already has similar approaches as part of its social media strategy, an out-of-our-niche podcast could come in handy. This strategy has shown success in the past when implemented by other brands (Nude Project is a great example). Branching out from our niche could boost our brand awareness.</p>

    <div class="idea-item">
        <img id="idea3" src="/idea_3.jpg"/>
        <h3 class="h3-format">INFLUENCER MARKETING</h3>
        <p>Halborn's co-marketing strategy could also be aimed at collaborations with social media influencers who are (even if vaguely) related to the sector and can add a touch of freshness and joviality to our brand.</p>
